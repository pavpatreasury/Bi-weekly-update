**About the PA/vPA Operations Treasury**:  This is a side treasury of the Project Catalyst ecosystem dedicated to the iteration and development of the PA/vPA (QA) stage of Catalyst.  It functions primarily through rapid-funding of small claims for projects, bounties for recurrent community tasks, and distribution of work and governance within the community via the chartering of Working Groups.
